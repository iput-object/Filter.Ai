# Filter.AI

AI-powered spam detection and moderation bot for Telegram groups using Google Gemini.

## Overview

Filter.AI is an intelligent Telegram bot that helps keep your group chats clean and civilized. Using Google's Gemini AI, it analyzes reported messages to detect spam and uncivilized content, automatically banning offenders and maintaining a detailed log of all actions.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Leverages Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for intelligent message classification
- **Automatic Moderation**: Bans users and deletes messages identified as spam or uncivilized
- **Detailed Logging**: Maintains a CSV(for local) and @t.me/filterAiLogs for production log of all banned users with timestamps and reasons
- **Simple Commands**: Easy-to-use interface with `/start` and `/report` commands
- **Privacy-Focused**: Only analyzes messages when explicitly reported by group members

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A Telegram Bot Token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- A Google Gemini API Key (from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iput-object/Filter.Ai.git
   cd Filter.Ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and add your credentials:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   TELEGRAM_LOG_CHANNEL=your_telegram_log_channel_id_here
   ENVIRONMENT=your_build_environment_here #PRODUCTION OR DEVELOPMENT
   ```

4. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Running with Docker.
### Local Deployment

```bash
docker compose up --build filterai-local
```

* Uses `.env` file for credentials.
* Stops and removes safely:

```bash
docker compose down filterai-local
```

---

### Production Deployment

```bash
docker compose up -d filterai-production
```

* Uses environment variables injected by your hosting platform (e.g., Railway).
* `.env` is ignored in production.
* Stop and remove production container safely:

```bash
docker compose stop filterai-production
docker compose rm filterai-production
```

## Usage

### Setting Up in Your Group

1. Add the bot to your Telegram group
2. Promote the bot to admin with the following permissions:
   - Delete messages
   - Ban users

### Commands

- `/start` - Display help and documentation
- `/report` - Report a message (must be used as a reply to the message you want to report)

### How It Works

1. A user replies to a suspicious message with `/report`
2. The bot analyzes the message content using Gemini AI
3. If classified as "spam" or "uncivilized":
   - The message is deleted
   - The user is banned from the group
   - The incident is logged to `banned_logs.csv` or to @t.me/filterAiLogs
4. If the message is safe, the bot notifies that no action is needed

## Logging

LOCAL: All ban actions are logged to `banned_logs.csv` with the following information:
- Timestamp
- User ID
- Username
- Reason (spam/uncivilized)
- Message content
PRODUCTION: All bans will be logged to @t.me/filterAiLogs (Depends on the CHANNEL_ID)
